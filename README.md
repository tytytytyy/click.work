# click.work

**click.work** is an interactive digital artwork that explores the invisible labor behind artificial intelligence. It simulates microtasks such as image labeling and data tagging to highlight the precarious and underpaid conditions of data workers. 

By stepping into the role of a data worker, viewers experience firsthand the harsh realities and exploitative nature of this labor. Tasks accelerate in speed with each interaction, while a live wage counter tracks the minimal earnings. This simulates the overwhelming demands faced by data workers.

After completing each task, fragments of lived experience appear, shedding light on the ethical concerns and human toll of digital labor. **click.work** challenges the viewer to reflect on the exploitation within the digital economy and the human cost of AI systems.
